<h1></h1>The Best Movies According to Charles
<h2></h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.
<hr />
<p><strong>Shawshank Redemption</strong><br />
Just a really good film, and story of friendship.<br />
<strong>Avengers</strong><br />
Never thought I would ever see a movie like this on the big screen.<br />
<strong>Godfather I</strong><br />
I just like the setting and memories of watching it with my mother.</p>
